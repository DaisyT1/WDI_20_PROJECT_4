#S E T
-

S E T was created on the literal intepretation of 'Spotify Discover'. Users can search songs on Spotify and pin the track to a location that reminds them of that song. You can also discover new music through places you like. This was my final project at GA, a 12 week coding bootcamp. See a live demo [here](https://frozen-inlet-88275.herokuapp.com/).

###Technology:

This app was written using a **MEAN** stack.

package.json:

```"body-parser": "^1.15.1"

    "cors": "^2.7.1"
    "express": "^4.14.0"
    "mongoose": "^4.5.3"
    "morgan": "^1.7.0"
```

APIs:

- Spotify
- ng-maps


CSS Framework:

##Additions
Things i would like to implement into the app in the future:

- Display users individual pinned locations.
- Play around with the UI/UX and design.
- Search the map for locations, not having to click your way around the world.
